# 3DED-data-rank
A Jupyter Notebook that reads the csv file generated by PETS2 software project explorer function, then sorts the data to different crystal types based on the lattice parameters. By considering the mosaicity, R-values, resolution, and CC1/2 it ranks the quality of the data. Data should be processed completely in PETS2 first!
